📌 Overview
This repository contains implementations of various AI practicals completed as part of the Semester VI curriculum. The practicals cover fundamental AI concepts, including search algorithms, constraint satisfaction problems, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

🔥 Practicals Implemented:

1️⃣ Breadth-First Search (BFS) Implementation 🌍

Applied BFS on a given dataset.

Explores nodes level by level, ensuring the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

2️⃣ Depth-First Search (DFS) Implementation 🔎

Implemented DFS on a given dataset.

Explores as deep as possible before backtracking, useful for pathfinding and solving puzzles.

3️⃣ 8-Queens Problem ♟️

Developed a solution using backtracking.

Ensures no two queens attack each other on the chessboard.

4️⃣ Exploring Open Source NLP Tools 📖

Worked with NLP libraries like NLTK for text analysis and processing.

Covered tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and feature extraction.

5️⃣ Text Preprocessing with NLTK 📝

Implemented tokenization, stopword removal, and stemming in a case study application.

Used NLTK for preprocessing text data to enhance analysis.
